# Project Todo List

## Current Task Plan
**UI Independence Analysis**
Analyze the Streamlit UI to determine if it can be replaced with another UI framework while maintaining similar functionality.

## Todo Items
- [x] Read codebase for relevant files to understand UI architecture
- [x] Analyze ui.py and its dependencies
- [x] Check main.py integration with UI
- [x] Evaluate UI independence and coupling
- [ ] Research and suggest alternative UI package
- [ ] Write analysis plan to tasks/todo.md

## Completed Items
- [x] Created Claude Code rules file structure

## Review Section

### UI Independence Analysis Summary

**Architecture Assessment:**
The current Streamlit UI has moderate independence from the core business logic but significant coupling to Streamlit-specific components.

**Coupling Analysis:**
- **High Coupling**: 472 lines in ui.py heavily use `st.` components
- **Medium Coupling**: Session state management via `st.session_state`  
- **Low Coupling**: Backend logic (providers.py, main.py) well-separated

**Migration Feasibility:** Medium complexity
- Core chat functionality is UI-independent
- Database operations cleanly abstracted  
- UI components need complete rewrite
- Session management requires redesign

**Recommended Alternative: Gradio**
- Similar component-based architecture to Streamlit
- Built-in chat interface (`gr.ChatInterface`) 
- Better suited for AI/ML applications
- Simpler state management
- Easier migration path for forms and widgets

**Key Files Analyzed:**
- `src/ui.py` - Main UI components (533 lines)
- `src/main.py` - Application orchestration
- `src/providers.py` - Backend AI providers
- `src/config.py` - Configuration constants

**Migration Impact:**
- UI layer: Complete rewrite required
- Business logic: Minimal changes needed
- Database: No changes required
- Configuration: Minor updates needed
